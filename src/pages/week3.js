        In week 3 I started working on the website for my pep. I had a talk with
        the technical teachers if I can try to make the guess the word game
        using React+Flast (basically make a full stack application) Using React
        (javascript) for front-end and Flask (python) for back-end. Both of them
        said it was okay if Iâ€™m learning new things and growing as a programmer.
        <br />
        After that talk I started searching up on how can I do it and I found
        some pretty interesting websites : 1-

        After figuring out how to make the full-stack application I started
        working on my PEP website. I started off by creating a react app and I
        started building onto it.

        After that I started off by making the footer and the card components in
        the research tab which you can find how it looks while browsing the
        site.
