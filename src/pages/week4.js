      <p id="text">
        In my opinion the profile that most suits me will be the Software
        engineering one. Because my main goal one day is to become a developer
        and potentially one day a CTO/CEO. I like it the most because it will
        help me learn software engineering, and most importantly Data structures
        and algorithms. I don’t like the other profiles because I just don’t
        like the topics or I see no point in them. I don’t understand the
        business profile because in my opinion you don’t study business you do
        business. You make your own company and with trial and error you learn
        from your mistakes. And for media I just don’t like the idea of creating
        UI’s or working with css. <br />
        For me I think DB(demand based) suits me better because it gives me the
        freedom of learning on my own. Experimenting with stuff, trial and error
        and eventually learn from my mistakes and never make’em again. <br />I
        think if you need more information about the profiles you can find it on
        the website of Fontys and/or ask your teachers/student coach about more
        info.
        <br />
        For now, I’m not having any doubts about anything.
